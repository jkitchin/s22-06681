It is usually a set of numerical values that are collected. It is critical to know something about your data so you understand what analysis may be appropriate. Data is a plural word. Datum is the singular form of data.\n\nFor example, here are two sets of data on my weight:\n\n1.  [7.5, 46, 150, 157]\n2.  [156, 155, 158, 157]\n\nWe are missing some context on these. The first set is data over four decades, while the second set is over four days. It doesn't really make sense to average the first set, whereas the average of the second set gives you a good idea of how my weight fluctuates on a daily basis.\n\nData by itself is not helpful. It is analysis of data that is helpful, but you have to know what the data is supposed to represent to know if the analysis is helpful.\n\nThere are many kinds of analysis one can do: statistical, regression, integration, etc. Each of these has the purpose of extracting information from the data.\n\nLet's consider the average and standard deviation of the second weights above. To perform this analysis, we need a computational tool, we will use Python. We will extensively use numpy arrays for data analysis. We start by making an array in a variable called weights. Then, we simply call the mean and std functions of that array inside a formatted string.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"My average weight is 156.5 \\pm 1.1 lbs."}],"source":["import numpy as np\n\nweights = np.array([156, 155, 158, 157])\nprint(f'My average weight is {np.mean(weights)} \\pm {np.std(weights):1.1f} lbs.')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["This analysis makes sense *if* we think my weight fluctuates about some average with a normal distribution of fluctuations. We do not have enough data to determine if it is normal here, but it is worth noting that assumption underlies the analysis. Note, we also assume that each measurement is independent, and uncorrelated with the previous and next measurement. If I weigh myself only once a day, that is probably reasonable. If these are sequential weights separated by 1 minute, then either something is wrong with the scale or, I am doing something funny in how I weigh myself.\n\nWhat factors could affect the weight measurement?\n\n1.  What am I wearing?\n2.  What and when did I last eat/drink?\n3.  When was the last time I exercised and for how long?\n4.  Are all the measurements from the same scale?\n\nThe answers for all these constitute the *metadata*, which is data about the data. If we had access to this metadata, we might ask if any of these factors influence the measurements. As we consider more dimensions like this,  it becomes inconvenient to visualize and build models with conventional tools, and we then will turn to machine learning.\n\nThere is a lot to learn about using data before we get to machine learning though.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Reference material\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   [https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)\n    -   There is a lot here that some of you may find interesting.\n\n-   Keyboard shortcuts ![img](https://blog.ja-ke.tech/assets/jupyterlab-shortcuts/Shortcuts.png)\n    -   You do not need to memorize these, but they will eventually help you do some things faster\n\n-   [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.statistics.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.statistics.html)\n    -   Familiarize yourself with what is possible.
